**Request for Proposals (RFP):** Mitigating Urban Heat Islands for Vulnerable Populations in Developing Countries  
**Issued by:** Civic Literacy Initiative  
**Date of Issue:** April 19, 2024  

**1. Introduction and Background**

The Civic Literacy Initiative aims to improve environmental resilience and public health in urban areas of developing countries. Urban heat islands (UHI) significantly exacerbate the risks to vulnerable populations, including urban homeless and migrants living in temporary camps, who lack adequate shelter and resources to cope with extreme heat. This RFP seeks innovative, data-driven proposals to analyze and mitigate the effects of urban heat islands, particularly focusing on these high-risk groups.

**2. Objective**

The primary objective of this RFP is to solicit proposals that utilize geospatial and weather data to:

Identify urban areas most affected by the urban heat island effect, with a particular focus on regions inhabited by vulnerable populations such as the homeless and migrants.
Develop actionable, data-driven strategies to reduce temperature disparities and improve conditions for these populations.

**3. Scope of Work**

Proposals should comprehensively address the following key areas:

* Data Collection and Analysis: Leverage data with geographical elements, alongside weather data to analyze temperature variations and heat exposure risks.
* Solution Development: Propose data-driven solutions tailored to enhance heat resilience among vulnerable populations that would be sustainable and empower the people supporting those vulnerable populations.
* Implementation Plan: Detail the steps, resources, and partnerships needed to implement these solutions, considering the unique needs and mobility of the target groups.

**4. Proposal Requirements**

Proposals must include the following components:

* Project Description: A detailed description of the project, pinpointing specific areas, the demographics of the affected vulnerable populations, and the proposed mitigation strategies.
* Methodology: An outline of methodologies for utilizing data to understand and address UHI effects on vulnerable populations.

**5. Evaluation Criteria**

Proposals will be evaluated based on:

* Relevance and Innovation: Alignment with the RFP objectives and innovative approaches to mitigate UHI effects for vulnerable groups.
* Data-Driven Approach: Robustness in using data to identify high-risk areas and support targeted solutions.
* Feasibility and Impact: Practicality of the implementation plan and potential impact on improving living conditions for the homeless and migrants.
* Scalability: Ability to scale and adapt solutions to other urban settings with similar challenges.

**6. Timeline**

* Proposal Submission Deadline: [Deadline Date]
* Evaluation Period: [Start Date] to [End Date]
* Award Notification: [Notification Date]
* Project Start Date: [Start Date]
