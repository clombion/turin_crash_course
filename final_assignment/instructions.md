# Final assignment - Instructions

The final assignment aims to help students practice autonomously the skills and techniques explored during the crash course. It will be validated once a pull request is sent to the [crash course's main Github repository](https://github.com/clombion/turin_crash_course/blob/master/final_assignment/api_testbench.ipynb) and a link is added to Moodle. Assignment scoring will go from 15 to 30, with 15 being a non-passing grade.

## Objectives
* practice the process of analysing a RFP's key expectations as well as the needs and risks not explicitely outlined
* practice conducting a small data project to validate a proposal idea and build fact-based arguments
* practice querying APIs with bash scripts to collect data
* practice documenting and sharing your work using git, Github codespaces and jupyter notebooks.
* practice data storytelling
* (bonus) document a new API and send a pull request to add it to the [collaborative API library](https://github.com/clombion/turin_crash_course/blob/master/final_assignment/api_testbench.ipynb)

## Deadline
* Monday, April 29

## Instructions
Using what you have learned during the crash course, formulate a proposal to the [assignment RFP](https://github.com/clombion/turin_crash_course/blob/master/final_assignment/RFP.md) that includes
* A description of your proposed approach
* A description of the proposed methodology
* A description of your sources (data or otherwise)
* A documentation of your technical steps (jupyter notebook, openrefine history export, spreadsheet link etc)

To get full points on your assignment, you are expected to
* Demonstrate through your proposed approach that you
  * have carefully identified the key expectations, needs and risks of the RFP (1.5 points)
  * can integrate your research in your argumentation by using data-based arguments (1.5 points)
* Demonstrate through your proposed methodology your capacity to structure a coherent data-driven project (3 points)
* Demonstrate through your list of sources your ability to research and use sources in order to validate your idea and strengthen your argumentation (3 points)
* Demonstrate through your technical documentation that you are able to
  * use an API to fetch data for your research (1.5 points)
  * use other tools to clean and analyse the data (1.5 points)
* Send your final assignment as a pull request to the main Github repository (3 points)

| **Proposed Approach**      | Approach description<br>- Identify key RFP aspects<br>- Use data in arguments         | 3          |
| **Proposed Methodology**   | Methodology description<br>- Clear structure for the data-driven project              | 3          |

| **Technical Documentation**| Technical steps documentation<br>- API & Jupyter notebook for data collection<br>- Clean & Analyse with other tools  | 3          |
| **Submission**             | Pull request submission to the crash course Github folder                              | 3          |


## Notes
* Your technical steps must include a Jupyter notebook and code to request an API. The choice of tools for cleaning and analysing the data is yours
* Your pull request should have your assignment inside your personal folder in the shared repository
* Until the deadline, any question or any help request is accepted and will not reflect on your final grade. This includes pull requests sent for review.
* **Bonus points:** Up to 2 bonus points will be granted if you contribute a new API documentation in the collaborative API library. This contribution should be done through a pull request.
