United States of America
Cross sectional
o In 86% of the cities in the United States, individuals who were over the age of 65 tended to have lower exposure to the UHI effect compared to those who are under the age of 65.
o Individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups in every age group were exposed to noticeably higher levels of heat compared to their white counterparts.

Ecological
o During the period of high mortality, there was a notable difference in the gender distribution of deaths. Specifically, on August 12th in France and August 13th in Italy, there was a significant increase in the proportion of female deaths, with a 21% increase in France and a 14% increase in Italy.

o The risk of mortality increased with age.
o For those aged 45 and older, mortality was 15% higher in women compared to men of the same age
o Widowed, single, and divorced individuals had a higher mortality rate than married individuals.
o Cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, nervous system diseases, and other ill-defined morbid disorders also contributed significantly to higher mortality

Italy
Ecological
o The risk of mortality was greater in older individuals (2.13; 95% CI = 1.94, 2.33) during the heat events.
o The risk of mortality was greater in women (1.88; 95% CI = 1.77, 2.00) and in older individuals (2.13; 95% CI = 1.94, 2.33).
o The risk of mortality showed a significant association with education levels, men had a higher risk with higher education levels (1.66; 95% CI = 1.38, 1.99), and women had a higher risk with lower education levels (1.93; 95% CI = 1.79, 2.08).
o There was a higher risk of all-cause mortality among widowed men (1.66; 95% CI = 1.38, 2.00) and separated or divorced women (2.11; 95% CI = 1.51, 2.94).
Men who lived alone have a stronger association with mortality risk (1.61; 95% CI = 1.39, 1.86), while for women, the results were similar for both groups, who lived alone and not.

Ecological
o Individual aged ≥ 65 years had the highest rate of heat-related deaths (0.7 per 100,000 population).
o 70% of heat-related deaths occurred in males excepts for infants aged <1 year.
o Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives had the highest rate of heat-related deaths (0.6 per 100,000 population).
o Non-Hispanic blacks had the second-highest number of heat-related deaths (1,965) and rate (0.3 per 100,000 population).
Ngarambe et al. 2022 45

Ecological
o The effect of rising temperatures on mortality was more pronounced among males and individuals who were ≥ 65 years old.
Huang et al. 2015 46
China
Ecological
o Individual factors that increased susceptibility to the effects of heat included elderly, female, died outside of a hospital setting, died of respiratory diseases, and had a lower level of education.
Chan et al. 2012 28
Hong Kong
Ecological
o Women were more vulnerable to heat-related mortality.
o Married people were more vulnerable to heat-related mortality.
o High temperatures had a greater effect on non-cancer related causes of death, such as cardiovascular and respiratory infections.
o People lived in low socioeconomic districts, were more vulnerable to heat-related mortality.
o High temperatures had a greater effect on non-cancer related causes of death, such as cardiovascular and respiratory infections.

United States of America
Ecological
o Non-Hispanic blacks were 52% more likelihood (95% CI: 37%, 69%) to live in areas with heat-risk related conditions than non-Hispanic whites.
o Non-Hispanic Asians had a 32% higher likelihood (95% CI: 18%, 47%), while Hispanics had a 21% higher likelihood (95% CI: 8%, 35%) of living in such areas compared to non-Hispanic whites.
Wong et al. 2016 60
Hong Kong
Ecological
o The risk of being exposed to intense urban heat island effect was higher for individuals who were widowed, divorced, or separated.
o Individuals who were 60 years or older, had lower levels of education, were widow, divorced, or separated and had low or middle incomes, were at a higher risk of being exposed to intense urban heat island effect.
o People who have low or middle incomes, were at a higher risk of being exposed to intense UHI effect.

Ecological
o There were strong links between exposure to heat and populations who had minimal education or had limited English proficiency.
o There was a notable correlation between low-income populations and their susceptibility to the effects of heat exposure.

Cross sectional
o The intense summer heat in brickfields led to physiological strain among female workers making them more susceptible to UHI phenomenon.

Ecological
o High-risk areas for extreme heat were associated with a low number of high-income earners and a higher population density.
Zander et al. 2018 81
Philippines
Cross-sectional
o Population density was positively associated with the level of heat stress experienced by respondents. Those who felt little heat stress lived in areas with lower population density (less than 1467 people/km2), while those with higher levels of heat stress lived in areas with higher population density (up to 41,500 people/km2 in Manila City).
