    "\n",
    "* ### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"urban heat island\" (UHI) refers to a phenomenon that occurs when temperatures in urban areas are higher than those in the areas that surround them (suburban area).\n",
    "\n",
    "The urban heat island phenomenon can result in increase of energy consumption, increase of air pollution, decrease of water quality, and increase of greenhouse gas emissions, all of which have the potential to negatively impact people in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about \"Urban Heat Islands for Vulnerable Populations,\" we refer to groups of people such as the homeless, migrants, elderly individuals, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. These groups often have less access to resources to protect themselves from extreme heat, such as air conditioning, adequate shelter, or access to clean water. This situation could lead in health problems as heat strokers or dehydaration. \n",
    "\n",
    "UHI have additional environmental effects, including increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. UHI worsens air quality due to higher fossil fuel consumption, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants like sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to the greenhouse effect.\n",

There is no dry season in a tropical rainforest environment, and it rains at least 60 mm per month throughout the year (2.36 in). Tropical rainforest climates do not have distinct seasons; it is hot and humid year-round, with frequent and heavy rains. Manila has an annual average temperature of 27.8 degrees Celsius, or 82.0 degrees Fahrenheit. With an average temperature of 85.0 °F (29.4 °C), April is the hottest month of the year, while the lowest month is January at 79.0 °F (26.1 °C).\n",
