# Introduction

According to MIT Climate Portal, the urban heat island effect is a phenomenon whereby cities experience higher air temperatures than the surrounding countryside. Scientists refer to areas afflicted by these higher temperatures as urban heat islands, and people living in these areas are particularly exposed to the effects of climate change. People living in urban heat islands are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. As the planet warms, urban heat islands will only intensify those higher temperatures.(https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/urban-heat-islands).

In general, certain social groups are particularly vulnerable to crises, including climate change. These vulnerable people are **children**, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities, **migrant workers**, **displaced persons**, **older people**, and other socially marginalized groups. (https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/social-dimensions-of-climate-change#1).

If we focus our attention on migrants (and in particular refugees) and displaced people, the UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) states that the vast majority of refugees (approximately 78 percent) do not live in camps but in cities, and are therefore more vulnerable to the extreme heatwaves caused by climate change. In general urban locations offer more opportunities to live autonomously and find employment, but they also pose major challenges as refugees are often forced to share accommodation or live in non-functional public buildings, collective centers, slums or other types of informal settlements with substandard living conditions.

# Project Description

The aim of this project is developing an **SMS-heat-alert** and **health-check system** that **forcibly displaced population** (including internally dispaced people, refugees, asylum-seekers and other people in need of international protection that settled in **urban locations** in **developing countries** of asylum affected by **extreme heat conditions**) could benefit from by receving heat alerts in case of extreme weather conditions together with multilingual advice on practices to avoid heat-realted diseases. Moreover, they could communicate any heat-related symptoms they might experience through a multilingual SMS-form. The system would be created by and integrated with **FDP-centers** in the cities of reference where those in need could register (to create a database shared in all the urban areas) and get support, and where training to maintain the system will be delivered. The staff of these centers would consist of vulnerable people from different nationalities themselves, thus making the project multilingual, sustainable in the long-term, and scalable to other urban settlements.

It is important to note that extreme heat and its consequences on health are not the only one consequence of climate change, which include floods, draught, threat to biodiversity and agriculture, and extreme weather conditions. Moreover, forcibly displaced people do not only settle in urban areas in developing countries, but often chose least-developed countries, as well as developed ones, and they all have the same importance. Urban refugees do not only face weather-related challenges, but many more, and the UNHCR and other aid agencies cannot legally protect and support refugees dispersed in urban settings as much as in camps: it is therefore important to establish centers in urban settements where the vulnerable people feel safe to register and go to when they are in need. Collaboration between cities hosting forcibly displaced people, and partnership with NGOs and local 

# Research question

How can we identify the urban areas where to deploy the project?

# Hypotheses

We can use historical weather data and data from UNCHR to identify the areas where to deploy the project first. 

# Hypothesis notes

* Coordinates of urban settlements
* Weather Data
* Demographics of urban refugees (main focus on urban settlements of forcibly displaced population with more than 50 kids < 4 years old and 50 elderly > 60 years old. According to WHO, infants or people who are over 60 years of age or that have chronic health conditions are those most affected by heat-related diseases).

# Data sources and tools

* https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=0quh0N
  THe UNHCR provides a database with the demographics of forcibly displaced population including internally dispaced people, refugees, asylum-seekers and other people in need of international protection that settled in urban locations in the countries of asylum. Since there is no universal definition of urban, UNCHR classifies an urban location as a settlement with more than 5,000 inhabitants. Data for 2021 and 2022.
