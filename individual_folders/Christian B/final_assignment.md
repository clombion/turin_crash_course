Urban Heat Islands" (UHIs) refers to urban areas where the temperature is significantly higher than in surrounding areas, due to the concentration of buildings, roads, pavements, and other structures that absorb and retain heat. These areas tend to experience higher temperatures than nearby rural areas, especially during the summer months.

When we talk about "Urban Heat Islands for Vulnerable Populations," we refer to groups of people such as the homeless, migrants, elderly individuals, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. These groups often have less access to resources to protect themselves from extreme heat, such as air conditioning, adequate shelter, or access to clean water.

This situation could lead in health problems as heat strokers or dehydaration. 

# Project description
Project aims to identify urban areas affected by UHIs impacting vulnerable populations. The proposal will propose and develop actionable strategies based on geospatial and weather data to reduce disparities and improve conditions.

# Define
## Research question
How to change conditions and reduce disparities caused by UHIs to improve vulnerable population lives?
## Hypotheses
The mapping and the identification of UHIs can provide guidance to modify those areas. 

## Hypothesis notes
**Find data from the weather systems (forecast and historic) by locations. Areas with high density of vulnerable population to map it. Idenitfy possible solutions and the available resources in the area **
# Find	
## Data sources
* Openstreet map and geospatial data
* Studies and information with solutions to avoud UHIs
* [UHI information](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/7/917)
* Data collection weather hystory and forecast
* Identify heat points where vulnerable population are located.
* UHIs information
* Available resources in the area (forests, parks, rivers, sea... )


## Contextual resources


# Get

* Obtain information from areas with populations that are a state of vulnerability, be able to identify the areas and create a map.
   * We classified the data through 3 ranges: (1) a low socioeconomic classification considering TWi values between 0.1 and 0.4; (2) an average socioeconomic classification with TWi values between 0.5 and 0.7; and (3) a high socioeconomic classification consisting of TWi values between 0.8 and 1.
* Get weather information from cities and regions
* Based on studies, find ways to alleviate hot spots.
* Mix everything and, having identified the areas, create proposals based on studies.
