## ABSTRACT

In this assignment the Urban Heat Island effect is investigated and the effect of urbanization on UHI is
analyzed as a case study in Nairobi City. The primary aim of this study was to provide a
comprehensive quantification of the effect of Urbanization to the UHI effect to the urban
planning management. The study consisted of three parts; Analysis of Urbanization using the
DMSP/OLS nighttime light images, investigation of UHI effect using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS
images and correlation analysis between the UHI, NDVI (representing vegetated surfaces) and
Urbanization(landuse/Landcover) to establish a relationship between the UHI effect and
urbanization. A mono-window algorithm was used to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST)
distribution from the Landsat 8 images, using specifically band 10 and band 11 images. The
spatial pattern of LST in the study area retrieved to characterize their local effects on the urban
heat islands. In addition, the correlation between LST and the NDVI (Normalized difference
vegetation index), Urbanization was analyzed to explore the impacts of the vegetation and
urbanization on the urban heat island effect. The results indicate that, though not pronounced,
there is a distribution of heat islands in Nairobi. The negative correlation between LST and
NDVI suggests that vegetation weakens the heat island effect, while the positive correlation
between LST and Urbanization indicates that the urbanization elevates the heat island effect. The
study concluded that, with the rate of urbanization, the distributed heat island, with time will
conglomerate into a large heat island in the region. Although satellite data (e.g., Landsat 8 level
one products) can be applied effectively to examine the distribution of urban heat islands, the
research still needs to be refined with in situ measurements of LST in future studies.

# Project description
Project aims to identify urban areas affected by UHIs impacting vulnerable populations. The proposal will propose and develop actionable strategies based on geospatial and weather data to reduce disparities and improve conditions.

# Define
## Research question
How to change conditions and reduce disparities caused by UHIs to improve vulnerable population lives?
## Hypotheses
The mapping and the identification of UHIs can provide guidance to modify those areas. 

## Hypothesis notes
**Find data from the weather systems (forecast and historic) by locations. Areas with high density of vulnerable population to map it. Idenitfy possible solutions and the available resources in the area **
# Find	
## Data sources
* Openstreet map and geospatial data
* Studies and information with solutions to avoud UHIs
* [UHI information](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/7/917)
* Data collection weather hystory and forecast
* Identify heat points where vulnerable population are located.
* UHIs information
* Available resources in the area (forests, parks, rivers, sea... )


## Contextual resources


# Get

* Obtain information from areas with populations that are a state of vulnerability, be able to identify the areas and create a map.
   * We classified the data through 3 ranges: (1) a low socioeconomic classification considering TWi values between 0.1 and 0.4; (2) an average socioeconomic classification with TWi values between 0.5 and 0.7; and (3) a high socioeconomic classification consisting of TWi values between 0.8 and 1.
* Get weather information from cities and regions
* Based on studies, find ways to alleviate hot spots.
* Mix everything and, having identified the areas, create proposals based on studies.
