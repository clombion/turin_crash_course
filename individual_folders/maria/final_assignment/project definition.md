# Mitigating Urban Heat Islands for Vulnerable Populations in Developing Countries

## Project definition

The project aims to identify urban areas most affected by the urban heat island effect with focus on highly populated slums located in developing countries and inhabited mostly by vulnerable populations, such as urban poor, refugees, and homeless. 
People living in slums lack access to clean water and healthcare facilities, structural quality and durability of dwelling and infrastructures, and overcrowded spaces
UHI effect 

The UHI effects are exacerbating vulnerabilies of already vulnerable people living in slums, that lacks resources and means to cope with extreme heat. 

This proposal intends to present a sustainable mitigation strategy that can help decision-makers to improve their heat resilience and reduce temperature disparities.

## DEFINE

**Research question**

Is a monitoring system possible based on local weather stations (solar-powered?) in order to quickly allert people living in slums and inform about mitigation resources? 


**Hypothesis**

Vulnerable populations living in slums are more affected by the urban heat island effect 

**Hypothesis notes**

- urban growth
- lack of infrastructures and facilities
- heat waves
